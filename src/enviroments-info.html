					<h1 class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl">black root burrows</h1>
					<p>
						Black Root Burrows is a location in Ori and the Blind Forest, one of two new
						areas introduced in the Definitive Edition, the other being the Lost Grove.
						Its entrance is tucked away just above the first Spirit Well at the bottom of
						Sunken Glades, and it requires Wall Jump to be accessed.

					<h1 class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl">forlorn ruins</h1>
					<p>
						The Forlorn Ruins are a location in the Valley of the Wind in the forest of
						Nibel. Housing the Element of Winds, they were once home to the Gumon, a race
						of great inventors and agility who utilized the Spirit Tree's light in their
						machinery in order to protect themselves. After Kuro's actions, the Ruins
						became frozen over into a winter wasteland. The Gumon inside were unable to
						escape and were frozen to death, leaving only one survivor. The primary
						interest in the Forlorn Ruins is its Light Vessel, which provides power to all
						Gumon technology in the ruins. This object is used for a gameplay mechanic
						unique to the Ruins, and also serves as a means of highlighting the
						technological advances made by the Gumon.

				<div class="px-10">
					<h1 class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl">ginso tree</h1>
					<p>
						The Ginso Tree is a gigantic tree in the forest of Nibel. It houses the
						Element of Waters inside its trunk and was responsible for purifying the
						waters of the forest that passed through it. After Kuro's actions caused the
						Spirit Tree to lose his power, the Ginso Tree became rotten and dry, its inner
						chambers wrecked with Decay.

					class="enviroment-img"
				/>
				<div class="px-10">
					<h1 class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl">gumo's hideout</h1>
					<p>
						Gumo's Hideout is an area in Nibel where Gumo lives in a house, which is a
						part of Moon Grotto. It is a dark cave with glowing mushrooms, roots, and
						waterfalls, and contains many moving contraptions such as moving pillars and
						spikes (possibly made by Gumo). The area contains Leru's Ancestral Tree, which
						gives Ori the ability to Double Jump. It also contains the first "mid-boss"
						fight and a sequence involving a rock slide.

				<div class="px-10">
					<h1 class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl">Hollow grove</h1>
					<p>
						Hollow Grove is a heavily forested area with scattered lakes located centrally
						within Nibel. It acts as a center network for most of the different paths of
						the blind forest, allowing the other areas ways of connecting to one another.
						It covers a rather large area, stretching from the Spirit Tree, Valley of the
						Wind, Sunken Glades, Thornfelt Swamp, Moon Grotto, and Mount Horu.

				<div class="px-10">
					<h1 class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl">Kuro's nest</h1>
					<p>
						Kuro's Nest is a location within the Forlorn Ruins that serves as a home to
						Kuro, her Egg, and formerly, her Owlets. It is here where Ori discovers the
						motive behind Kuro's seemingly unexplained fury in a heart-wrenching
						flashback.

				<div class="px-10">
					<h1 class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl">lost grove</h1>
					<p>
						The Lost Grove is the sub-area of Black Root Burrows, the new area introduced
						in the Definitive Edition of Ori and the Blind Forest. The Lost Grove is the
						former home of Naru and her father; their shelter still lies untouched at the
						bottom of the grove. The Lost Grove cannot be accessed until its sister
						location, the Black Root Burrows, is completed, and even then Ori must have
						learned certain skills to progress. If Ori has not learnt Stomp, Sein will ask
						them to explore more of Nibel before returning and venturing into the Lost
						Grove.

				/>
				<div class="px-10">
					<h1 class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl">misty woods</h1>
					<p>
						The Misty Woods are a unique location as they do not have a map for Ori to
						reference as they journey through it. As they travel deeper into the trees,
						the layout of the forest itself changes with an ominous moaning of creaking
						wood, forcing Ori to backtrack through areas they have already passed through,
						only to see that they have changed. Many creatures of Nibel have ventured
						inside and never returned for this reason. Ori must journey inside the Misty
						Woods in order to find the Gumon Seal and unlock the Forlorn Ruins.

				<div class="px-10">
					<h1 class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl">moon grotto</h1>
					<p>
						The Moon Grotto is an area in Nibel. It is located below Thornfelt Swamp. Ori
						must go there in order to activate the second world event, obtaining the Water
						Vein. Moon Grotto is first introduced while chasing Gumo, marked by the large
						letters, the lasers, and the change in music. The spikes here cause more
						damage than that of prior areas, with one touch costing up to three life
						cells. Moon Grotto is also quite difficult for new players in general, but
						offers many secrets and side paths. This difficulty serves the functional
						purpose of getting players used to moving Ori in more elaborate manners.

				<div class="px-10">
					<h1 class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl">mount horu</h1>
					<p>
						Mount Horu is a giant volcanic mountain that serves as the final challenge Ori
						must overcome in their journey. Housing the Element of Warmth within its core,
						Mount Horu slowly builds towards an eruption throughout the course of the game
						and nearly results in the complete destruction of Nibel.

				<div class="px-10">
					<h1 class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl">nibel</h1>
					<p>
						The Forest of Nibel is an ancient forest which is the setting for Ori and the
						Blind Forest. It is also briefly featured in Ori and the Will of the Wisps.

				<div class="px-10">
					<h1 class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl">Sorrow pass</h1>
					<p>
						Sorrow Pass is a location in the forest of Nibel, located at the very top of
						the Valley of the Wind. It is the home of the Sunstone, an object which allows
						Ori to travel inside Mount Horu to rekindle the final Element of Light needed
						to save the forest.

			<div id="spider-coves" class="locations">

					alt="spider coves"
					class="enviroment-img"
				/>
				<div class="px-10">
					<h1 class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl">spider coves</h1>
					<p>
						The Spider Coves is a sub-area of Hollow Grove. It is a cave filled with
						roots, spiders, spiderwebs, and an underground pond. When Ori first enters the
						Spider Coves, they see a hanging boulder covered in web and spider eggs. To
						progress, Ori uses Charge Flame to detach the boulder from the web, causing it
						to fall to the ground. This allows Ori to safely avoid the thorns at the
						bottom of the pit.

				<div class="px-10">
					<h1 class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl">spirit caverns</h1>
					<p>
						The Spirit Caverns is a sub-area of the Sunken Glades. It is the third area
						entered in the game (second area if not counting the prologue). It is a
						forested area with many roots and caves, creating a setting with a morning
						atmosphere. It is in this area that Ori learns about Ancestral Trees and
						absorbs the first skill: Wall Jump.

			<div id="sunken-glades" class="locations">

					class="enviroment-img"
				/>
				<div class="px-10">
					<h1 class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl">sunken glades</h1>
					<p>
						The Sunken Glades is a location in Ori and the Blind Forest, the first
						non-prologue area that Ori can explore. Located somewhat near Swallow's Nest
						(the true first area), it is here that a weak and dying Ori is revived by the
						Spirit Tree's light.

			<div id="swallows-nest" class="locations">

				/>
				<div class="px-10">
					<h1 class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl">Swallow's Nest</h1>
					<p>
						Swallow's Nest is the first location in Ori and the Blind Forest. A
						neighborhood of Nibel, Swallow's Nest is the former home of Ori, and the
						current home of Naru and Ku. Swallow's Nest is an introductory area, and
						therefore has no enemies, secrets or collectibles.

			<div id="thornfelt-swamp" class="locations">

				<div class="px-10">
					<h1 class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl">Thornfelt Swamp</h1>
					<p>
						Thornfelt Swamp is a location in Ori and the Blind Forest. At first, it is
						seen as the location outside of the Ginso Tree, where you first encounter
						Gumo, who is stealing the Water Vein. He escapes into Moon Grotto, and then to
						Gumo's Hideout, the lower part of Moon Grotto. Ori is then attacked by Kuro
						after reaching the top of the Ginso Tree, and she pushes them off the Ginso
						Tree where Ori eventually lands in the Thornfelt Swamp, caught by Gumo. This
						is the location that Ori can learn the Stomp ability. The two parts of
						Thornfelt Swamp appear to be quite separated, and the only non-secret way is
						to go through Moon Grotto.

				<div class="px-10">
					<h1 class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl">Valley of the Wind</h1>
					<p>
						The Valley of the Winds is a canyon in Nibel that's filled with tunnels and
						pine trees. It is initially accessed from the left of the Spirit Tree above
						the Spirit Caverns and connects to the Misty Woods, Forlorn Ruins, and Sorrow
						Pass. It is in this area that Ori distracts Kuro and obtains Kuro's Feather.
