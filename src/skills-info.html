					Spirit Flame is the very first skill Ori
					learns, and one of only two skills
					obtained through a Story Event and not

				<p>
					Wall Jump is the second skill Ori
					learns, and the first skill to be had
					from an Ancestral Tree. Passed on to Ori
					by the light of Fil, it allows the young
					spirit to jump up and off of walls, and
					enables access to areas that cannot be
					reached by a single jump alone. It is
					essential to exploring Nibel. The
					Ancestral Tree for Wall Jump is found
					deep within the Sunken Glades.

					aerial jump produces a characteristic
					"V" on screen which indicates that Ori
					has taken a double jump. This skill is
					required to continue exploring Nibel
					after Gumo's Hideout, and the extra jump
					also makes many pickups accessible that
					otherwise weren't.
