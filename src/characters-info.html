				<h1>Ori</h1>
				<p>
					Ori is the titular protagonist of Ori
					and the Blind Forest, a Spirit who
					becomes separated from their biological
					and adoptive family and is placed into a
					journey to save the forest of Nibel from
					a dangerous Decay spreading throughout
					the land.
				</p>
				<h1>description</h1>
				<p>
					Ori is a small white creature with a
					similar stance to a human or a bunny and
					has a cat-like tail and large black eyes
					with white pupils. They have two short
					horn-like antennae on top of their head,
					and underneath them there are larger
					ears, which droop when Ori is unhappy or
					weak. Ori's feet have small white
					hooves, as seen in their 3D model sheet.
					Their name is of Hebrew origin,
					literally meaning "my light".

				<img

					alt="naru"
				/>

				<h1>Naru</h1>
				<p>
					When Ori became separated from the
					Spirit Tree during the Great Storm, Naru
					discovered the young spirit and raised
					it as her own child. Naru is of an
					unknown race and Ori's effective "foster
					mother".
				</p>
				<h1>description</h1>
				<p>
					Naru is a large and slow being. She has
					a very large spotted belly and her arms,
					chest, head and back are covered with
					black fur. Most of her lower half is a
					lighter shade of purple while her face
					is pure white.
				</p>
				<p>
					Naru is very motherly, caring and
					affectionate, especially towards Ori.
					She shares many personality traits with
					her parent and with the earlier days of
					Kuro, who both loved and cherished their
					children. Naru is also shown to be very
					determined and selfless, striving to
					find Ori even as Nibel was burning
					around her.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div
				id="kuro-section"
				class="characters-info"
			>
				<img
					src="./media/images/kuro.webp"
					alt="kuro"
				/>
				<h1>Kuro</h1>
				<p>
					Kuro is the main antagonist of Ori and
					the Blind Forest. She is a gigantic owl
					drenched in darkness, who despises the
					light. Kuro attempts to stop Ori from
					restoring the Spirit Tree along with the
					Enemies of Nibel.
				</p>
				<h1>description</h1>
				<p>
					Kuro is a massive owl with dark indigo
					plumage and a pale face. Her eyes are
					naturally an orange color until her
					corruption causes them to glow a bright
					white.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div
				id="sein-section"
				class="characters-info"
			>
				<img
					src="./media/images/sein.png"
					alt="sein"
				/>
				<h1>Sein</h1>
				<p>
					Sein is a floating globular being made
					of blue Light who always hovers around
					Ori's immediate vicinity. It
					communicates by chanting in an unknown
					language, often rhyming (or loosely
					rhyming) as it does so. It is a very
					common belief that Sein is a female
					character due to the voice, however this
					is not explicitly defined in canon lore,
					and as such, they are treated as
					genderless for the purposes of
					documentation.
				</p>
				<h1>description</h1>
				<p>
					With detailed knowledge of how the
					forest became blind, Sein acts as a
					guide for Ori to learn about the new
					world they find themselves in. It is
					thoroughly dedicated to its mission
					regardless of what happens, though also
					shows a great care for Ori as a remnant
					of the Spirit Tree itself.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div
				id="gumo-section"
				class="characters-info"
			>
				<img
					src="./media/images/gumo.webp"
					alt="gumo"
				/>
				<h1>Gumo</h1>
				<p>
					The last known member of a race of
					builders known as the Gumon, Gumo
					initially embraced the darkness when the
					forest of Nibel went blind. Initially
					acting as an antagonist to Ori, the
					kindness shown to him by the Spirit
					would ultimately turn him into an ally.
				</p>
				<h1>description</h1>
				<p>
					Sometime after the fall of the Spirit
					Tree when the Forest of Nibel turned
					blind, Gumo elected to embrace the
					darkness on his own accord, rather than
					fight it. This led him to steal the
					Water Vein, an item necessary to access
					the Ginso Tree which housed the Element
					of Waters, though he was spotted by Ori
					and Sein in the midst of this act.
				</p>

			<div
				id="naru-father-section"
				class="characters-info"
			>
				<img
					src="./media/images/naru-father.png"
					alt="naru-father"
				/>
				<h1>naru-father</h1>
				<p>
					Naru's Father is the biological parent
					of Naru, and belongs to an unknown
					species. As the single caretaker for his
					child, he was responsible for keeping
					her safe during her youth and stayed
					with her until she reached a mature age.
				</p>
				<h1>description</h1>
				<p>
					A creature of the dark who lived in the
					Lost Grove beneath the Black Root
					Burrows, Naru's Father cared greatly for
					his daughter, though to a point of being
					nearly overprotective.
