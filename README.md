We are creating a game wikipedia for the game ori and the blind forest.

design process
We chose a blue overall colour scheme because we thought that it would represent the games overall blue background. . As for the layout we chose to insert images and have a hamburger menu for convenience of people. We chose the ori font for headers as we thought that it would help immerse our players in our website better. As for the text we used Min Sans for font that’s easy on the eyes that’s closer to standard font for text.

features
exsisting features:
a login and signup section
a gacha system
a variable question generator from questions in a databse

Features Left to Implement:
using a database to do generate all the content(to allow a cookie cutter layout instead of a fixed one)

technology
ajax to communicate with the database
tailwind.css to make quick changes to the site
normalise.css to ensure the site looks the same on every browser
